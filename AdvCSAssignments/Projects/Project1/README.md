- Introduction to you
- Hobbies/Interests/Extra-curricular
- Skills
- Education
- Experience
- Projects (These do not need to be computer science related!)
- Contact Information
- References - What do people say about you?!

### Create a mockup

- Sketch out your site, where do you want the different elements to appear
- How will you break up your content?
- How will you navigate your content?

### Build it!

Now that you have all the elements, it is time to put them together to build a site that reflects YOU.  If you get stuck on how to style or position an element, refer to the course content up to this point or venture out to the Internet to find more help.

### Publish your site

Once you are done, launch your site (More on this later)
