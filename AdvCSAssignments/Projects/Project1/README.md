# Digital Portfolio

The purpose of this project is to create a digital portfolio.  The portfolio you create will offer a unique online presence that represents YOU â€“ your personality, your interests, your accomplishments, your goals  - and will ultimately serve as your promotional medium for future opportunities.

3. Brainstorm. Your portfolio should consist of the following sections (at a minimum).  Within each section, think of what you want to include.  For each section, you may not have much, or anything at all, but as you grow as a developer and person so too will the content.  

- Introduction to you
- Hobbies/Interests/Extra-curricular
- Skills
- Education
- Experience 
- Projects (These do not need to be computer science related!)
- Contact Information
- References - What do people say about you?!

4. Create a brand

6. Create a mockup

- Sketch out your site, where do you want the different elements to appear
- How will you break up your content?
- How will you navigate your content?

7. Build it!

- Now that you have all the elements, it is time to put them together to build a site that reflects YOU.  If you get stuck on how to style or position an element, refer to the course content up to this point or venture out to the Internet to find more help.  

8. Publish your site

- Once you are done, launch your site (More on this later)

9. Make your site scalable (Experts only)

- Your site should scale to different browsers other than your computer.  Your site should also scale to tablets, phones, etc. 

10. Test, test, test!  

- Test your site on as many browsers and devices as you can to ensure cross-compatibility. 

11.  Grade your site against the project requirements below.
