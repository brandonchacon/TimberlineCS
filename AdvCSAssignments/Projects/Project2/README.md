# Winter Scene
The purpose of this project is to develop an animated winter scene using javascript.  The project will utilize the <i>canvas</i> element, in combination with css and javascript, to create an animated scene that can be viewed on a webpage. 

## Your Tasks

### Familiarize yourself with Canvas

Before you get started on your digital scene, familiarize yourself with Canvas.  Navigate to the link below and complete the short canvas tutorial, 

- [https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp)

### Create a New Project in VS Code

Create a new project in VS Code.  Add the following files to the project container (These are located in the current directory), 

- index.html
- appStart.js
- style.css

### Complete the TODO tasks in appStart.js

Read over the appStart.js file you have been provided.  Complete all the TODO tasks listed in this file to get your snow falling.  Your falling snow (or whatever you decide to have falling ;-)) must meet the following criteria, 

- Snowflakes at random x and y locations
- Snowflakes that fall continuously vertically across the screen
- Snowflakes of random sizes
- Snowflakes that fall at an angle, depending on the wind parameter provided

### Add an additional animation

Once you have figured out how to get your snowflakes moving, add an additional animation.  This can be anything you choose.  Your animation must meet the following criteria, 

- The animation must be continuous 
- The animation must involve movement in a direction other than the vertical axis.  For example you could have a santa waving his hand or flying across the sky.  

### Add a background and additional elements to complete your scene  

The rest of your scene can be static drawings of your choosing.  Get creative and make something interesting.  On the day of your scheduled final, you will share your animation with the class.

Once you are done, publish your site on azure for the world to see!
