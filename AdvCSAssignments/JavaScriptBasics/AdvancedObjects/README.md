# Advanced Objects

Remember, objects in JavaScript are containers that store data and functionality. In this lesson, we will build upon the fundamentals of creating objects and explore some advanced concepts.

So if there are no objections, let's learn more about objects!

In this lesson we will cover these topics:

- how to use the this keyword.
- conveying privacy in JavaScript methods.
- defining getters and setters in objects.
- creating factory functions.
- using destructuring techniques.

## Your Tasks

### Getting Started

This assignment will follow the same workflow as the last assignment.  You will begin by making a new assignment directory within which you will create an index.html file and a app.js file.  To view the results of your JavaScipt code, you will be using console.  If you forgot how to do this, refer to the first assignment "Introduction to JavaScript".

- [ ] First create a new folder on your computer called AdvancedObjects.  Then, open the folder in VS Code.

- [ ] Add two new files to this folder, 

- index.html
- app.js

- [ ] In your index.html file, add the following code,

```
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </head>

</html>
``` 

### The this Keyword

Objects are collections of related data and functionality. We store that functionality in methods on our objects:

```
const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  }
};
```
In our goat object we have a .makeSound() method. We can invoke the .makeSound() method on goat.

```
goat.makeSound(); // Prints baaa
```
Nice, we have a goat object that can print baaa to the console. Everything seems to be working fine. What if we wanted to add a new method to our goat object called .diet() that prints the goat's dietType?

```
const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(dietType);
  }
};
goat.diet(); 
// Output will be "ReferenceError: dietType is not defined"
```

That's strange, why is dietType not defined even though it's a property of goat? That's because inside the scope of the .diet() method, we don't automatically have access to other properties of the goat object.

Here's where the this keyword comes to the rescue. If we change the .diet() method to use the this, the .diet() works! :

```
const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};

goat.diet(); 
// Output: herbivore
```

The this keyword references the calling object which provides access to the calling object's properties. In the example above, the calling object is goat and by using this we're accessing the goat object itself, and then the dietType property of goat by using property dot notation.

Let's get comfortable using the this keyword in a method.

- [ ] Copy and paste the code below into your app.js file, 

```
const robot = {
  
};
```

- [ ] In the object robot, add a property of model and assign to it a value of '1E78V2'. Add another property, energyLevel and assign to it a value of 100.

- [ ] Inside the robot object, add a method named provideInfo. Inside the body of provideInfo(), return the following string by using interpolation:

```
I am MODEL and my current energy level is ENERGYLEVEL.
```
Replace 'MODEL' and 'ENERGYLEVEL' with the calling object's model and energyLevel property. Remember, to get the access to the calling object's properties inside a method, you have to use the this keyword!

- [ ] Now to check .provideInfo() has access to the internal properties of robot. Log the result of calling .provideInfo() method on robot to the console.

### Arrow Functions and this

We saw in the previous exercise that for a method, the calling object is the object the method belongs to. If we use the this keyword in a method then the value of this is the calling object. However, it becomes a bit more complicated when we start using arrow functions for methods. Take a look at the example below:

```
const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet: () => {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};

goat.diet(); // Prints undefined
```
In the comment, you can see that goat.diet() would log undefined. So what happened? Notice that in the .diet() is defined using an arrow function.

Arrow functions inherently bind, or tie, an already defined this value to the function itself that is NOT the calling object. In the code snippet above, the value of this is the global object, or an object that exists in the global scope, which doesn't have a dietType property and therefore returns undefined.

To read more about either arrow functions or the [global object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object) check out the MDN documentation of the global object and [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).

The key takeaway from the example above is to avoid using arrow functions when using this in a method!

- [ ] Copy and paste the code below into your app.js file, 

```
const robot = {
  energyLevel: 100,
  checkEnergy: () => {
    console.log(`Energy is currently at ${this.energyLevel}%.`)
  }
}

robot.checkEnergy();
```

- [ ] Currently the .checkEnergy() method is not producing the correct output because it is using arrow function syntax.

Refactor, or change, the method to use a function expression. You can write the function using either longhand or shorthand format.

After refactoring the method, notice that .checkEnergy() has access to the other internal properties of the robot object.

### Privacy

Accessing and updating properties is fundamental in working with objects. However, there are cases in which we don't want other code simply accessing and updating an object's properties. When discussing privacy in objects, we define it as the idea that only certain properties should be mutable or able to change in value.

Certain languages have privacy built-in for objects, but JavaScript does not have this feature. Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. One common convention is to place an underscore _ before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Here's an example of using _ to prepend a property.

```
const bankAccount = {
  _amount: 1000
}
```

In the example above, the _amount is not intended to be directly manipulated.

Even so, it is still possible to reassign _amount:

```
bankAccount._amount = 1000000;
```

In later exercises, we'll cover the use of methods called getters and setters. Both methods are used to respect the intention of properties prepended, or began, with _. Getters can return the value of internal properties and setters can safely reassign property values. For now, let's see what happens if we can change properties that don't have setters or getters.

- [ ] Cut and paste the code below into your app.js file, 

```
const robot = {
  _energyLevel: 100,
  recharge(){
    this._energyLevel += 30;
    console.log(`Recharged! Energy is currently at ${this._energyLevel}%.`)
  }
};

```

- [ ] Below the robot object, reassign the _energyLevel property to 'high'.

- [ ] Now take a look at the new recharge method in robot. .recharge() will add 30 to _energyLevel.

What will happen now that _energyLevel isn't a number?

Call .recharge() on robot to find out.

Notice that a funky string is printed to the console! This is known as a side-effect of type-coercion. No need to worry about what this means for now, but it's important to understand that you can cause unwanted side-effects when mutating objects and their properties.

### Getters

Getters are methods that get and return the internal properties of an object. But they can do more than just retrieve the value of a property! Let's take a look at a getter method:

```
const person = {
  _firstName: 'John',
  _lastName: 'Doe',
  get fullName() {
    if (this._firstName && this._lastName){
      return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
    } else {
      return 'Missing a first name or a last name.';
    }
  }
}

// To call the getter method: 
person.fullName; // 'John Doe'
```
Notice that in the getter method above:

- We use the get keyword followed by a function.
- We use an if...else conditional to check if both _firstName and _lastName exist (by making sure they both return truthy values) and then return a different value depending on the result.
- We can access the calling object's internal properties using this. In fullName, we're accessing both this._firstName and this._lastName.
- In the last line we call fullName on person. In general, getter methods do not need to be called with a set of parentheses. Syntactically, it looks like we're accessing a property.

Now that we've gone over syntax, let's discuss what some notable advantages of using a getter method:

- Getters can perform an action on the data when getting a property.
- Getters can return different values using conditionals.
- In a getter, we can access the properties of the calling object using this.
- The functionality of our code is easier for other developers to understand.

Another thing to keep in mind when using getter (and setter) methods is that properties cannot share the same name as the getter/setter function. If we do so, then calling the method will result in an infinite call stack error. One workaround is to add an underscore before the property name like we did in the example above.

Great, let's go getter!

- [ ] Copy and paste the code below into your app.js file, 

```
const robot = {
  _model: '1E78V2',
  _energyLevel: 100,
  
};
```
- [ ] In robot, create a getter method named energyLevel using the get keyword. Leave function body blank for now.

- [ ] Inside the getter method, add an if statement to check if this._energyLevel is a number using the typeof operator. If that condition is truthy, return 'My current energy level is ENERGYLEVEL'. Replace ENERGYLEVEL with the value of this._energyLevel.

Make sure you return the string and not logging it to the console.

- [ ] Log the result of calling the getter method energyLevel on robot to the console.

Notice that the method will return a formatted response rather than just accessing a property!

### Methods

When the data stored on an object is a function we call that a method. A property is what an object has, while a method is what an object does.

Do object methods seem familiar? That’s because you've been using them all along! For example console is a global javascript object and .log() is a method on that object. Math is also a global javascript object and .floor() is a method on it.

We can include methods in our object literals by creating ordinary, comma-separated key-value pairs. The key serves as our method's name, while the value is an anonymous function expression.

```
const alienShip = {
  invade: function () { 
    console.log('Hello! We have come to dominate your planet. Instead of Earth, it shall be called New Xaculon.')
  }
};
```

With the new method syntax introduced in ES6 we can omit the colon and the function keyword.

```
const alienShip = {
  invade () { 
    console.log('Hello! We have come to dominate your planet. Instead of Earth, it shall be called New Xaculon.')
  }
};
```

Object methods are invoked by appending the object's name with the dot operator followed by the method name and parentheses:

```
alienShip.invade(); // Prints 'Hello! We have come to dominate your planet. Instead of Earth, it shall be called New Xaculon.'
```

- [ ] Copy and paste the code below into your app.js file

```
let retreatMessage = 'We no longer wish to conquer your planet. It is full of dogs, which we do not care for.';
```

- [ ] Below the retreatMessage variable, create an alienShip object. It should contain a method .retreat() which will console.log() the retreatMessage.

- [ ] Add another method to your object literal. This method, .takeOff(), should console.log() the string 'Spim... Borp... Glix... Blastoff!'.

- [ ] Invoke your two methods: first .retreat() then .takeOff().

### Nested Objects

In application code, objects are often nested— an object might have another object as a property which in turn could have a property that's an array of even more objects!

In our spaceship object, we want a crew object. This will contain all the crew members who do important work on the craft. Each of those crew members are objects themselves. They have properties like name, and degree, and they each have unique methods based on their roles. We can also nest other objects in the spaceship such as a telescope or nest details about the spaceship's computers inside a parent nanoelectronics object.

```
const spaceship = {
     telescope: {
        yearBuilt: 2018,
        model: '91031-XLT',
        focalLength: 2032 
     },
    crew: {
        captain: { 
            name: 'Sandra', 
            degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
            encourageTeam() { console.log('We got this!') } 
         }
    },
    engine: {
        model: 'Nimbus2000'
     },
     nanoelectronics: {
         computer: {
            terabytes: 100,
            monitors: 'HD'
         },
        'back-up': {
           battery: 'Lithium',
           terabytes: 50
         }
    }
};
```
We can chain operators to access nested properties. We'll have to pay attention to which operator makes sense to use in each layer. It can be helpful to pretend you are the computer and evaluate each expression from left to right so that each operation starts to feel a little more manageable.

```
spaceship.nanoelectronics['back-up'].battery; // Returns 'Lithium'
```

In the preceding code:

- First the computer evaluates spaceship.nanoelectronics, which results in an object containing the back-up and computer objects.
- We accessed the back-up object by appending ['back-up'].
- The back-up object has a battery property, accessed with .battery which returned the value stored there: 'Lithium'

- [ ] Copy and paste the code below into your app.js file, 

```
let spaceship = {
  passengers: null,
  telescope: {
    yearBuilt: 2018,
    model: "91031-XLT",
    focalLength: 2032 
  },
  crew: {
    captain: { 
      name: 'Sandra', 
      degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
      encourageTeam() { console.log('We got this!') },
     'favorite foods': ['cookies', 'cakes', 'candy', 'spinach'] }
  },
  engine: {
    model: "Nimbus2000"
  },
  nanoelectronics: {
    computer: {
      terabytes: 100,
      monitors: "HD"
    },
    backup: {
      battery: "Lithium",
      terabytes: 50
    }
  }
}; 

```
- [ ] Create a variable capFave and assign the captain's favorite food (the element in the 0th index of her 'favorite foods' array) to it. Make sure to use bracket and dot notation to get the value of the food through nested access (don't just copy the value into the variable!)

- [ ] Right now the passengers property has a value of null. Instead, assign as its value an array of objects. These objects should represent the spaceship's passengers as individual objects. Make at least one passenger object in the array that has at least one key-value pair on it.

- [ ] Create a variable firstPassenger and assign the first passenger as its value (the element in the 0th index of the spaceship.passengers array you just made). Make sure to use bracket and dot notation to get the passenger object through nested access (don't just copy the object into the variable!)

### Pass by Reference

Objects are passed by reference. This means when we pass a variable assigned to an object into a function as an argument, the computer interprets the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory holding that object. As a result, functions which change object properties actually mutate the object permanently (even when the object is assigned to a const variable).

```
const spaceship = {
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color : 'silver'
};

let paintIt = obj => {
  obj.color = 'glorious gold'
};

paintIt(spaceship);

spaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'
```
Our function paintIt() permanently changed the color of our spaceship object. However, reassignment of the spaceship variable wouldn't work in the same way:

```
let spaceship = {
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color : 'red'
};
let tryReassignment = obj => {
  obj = {
    identified : false, 
    'transport type' : 'flying'
  }
  console.log(obj) // Prints {'identified': false, 'transport type': 'flying'}

};
tryReassignment(spaceship) // The attempt at reassignment does not work.
spaceship // Still returns {homePlanet : 'Earth', color : 'red'};

spaceship = {
  identified : false, 
  'transport type': 'flying'
}; // Regular reassignment still works.
```
Let's look at what happened in the code example:

- We declared this spaceship object with let. This allowed us to reassign it to a new object with identified and 'transport type' properties with no problems.
- When we tried the same thing using a function designed to reassign the object passed into it, the reassignment didn't stick (even though calling console.log() on the object produced the expected result).
- When we passed spaceship into that function, obj became a reference to the memory location of the spaceship object, but not to the spaceship variable. This is because the obj parameter of the tryReassignment() function is a variable in its own right. The body of tryReassignment() has no knowledge of the spaceship variable at all!
- When we did the reassignment in the body of tryReassignment(), the obj variable came to refer to the memory location of the object {'identified' : false, 'transport type' : 'flying'}, while the spaceship variable was completely unchanged from its earlier value.

- [ ] Copy and paste the code below into your app.js file. 

```
let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type' : 'Turbo Fuel',
  homePlanet : 'Earth'
};
```
- [ ] Write a function greenEnergy() that has an object as a parameter and sets that object's 'Fuel Type' property to 'avocado oil'.

- [ ] Write a function remotelyDisable() that has an object as a parameter and sets (or reassigns) that object's disabled property to true.

- [ ] Call your two functions with the spaceship object in the code editor, then console.log() the spaceship object to confirm those properties were changed/added.

### Looping Through Objects

Loops are programming tools that repeat a block of code until a condition is met. We learned how to iterate through arrays using their numerical indexing, but the key-value pairs in objects aren't ordered! [JavaScript has given us alternative solution for iterating through objects with the for...in syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) .

for...in will execute a given block of code for each property in an object.

```
let spaceship = {
    crew: {
    captain: { 
        name: 'Lily', 
        degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
        cheerTeam() { console.log('You got this!') } 
        },
    'chief officer': { 
        name: 'Dan', 
        degree: 'Aerospace Engineering', 
        agree() { console.log('I agree, captain!') } 
        },
    medic: { 
        name: 'Clementine', 
        degree: 'Physics', 
        announce() { console.log(`Jets on!`) } },
    translator: {
        name: 'Shauna', 
        degree: 'Conservation Science', 
        powerFuel() { console.log('The tank is full!') } 
        }
    }
}; 
// for...in
for (let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
  console.log(`${crewMember}: ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].name}`)
};

```

Our for...in will iterate through each element of the spaceship.crew object. In each iteration, the variable crewMember is set to one of spaceship.crew's keys, enabling us to log a list of crew members' role and name.

- [ ] Copy and paste the code below into your app.js file, 

```
let spaceship = {
    crew: {
    captain: { 
        name: 'Lily', 
        degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
        cheerTeam() { console.log('You got this!') } 
        },
    'chief officer': { 
        name: 'Dan', 
        degree: 'Aerospace Engineering', 
        agree() { console.log('I agree, captain!') } 
        },
    medic: { 
        name: 'Clementine', 
        degree: 'Physics', 
        announce() { console.log(`Jets on!`) } },
    translator: {
        name: 'Shauna', 
        degree: 'Conservation Science', 
        powerFuel() { console.log('The tank is full!') } 
        }
    }
}; 

// Write your code below
```

- [ ] Using for...in, iterate through the spaceship.crew object in the code editor and console.log() a list of crew roles and names in the following format: '[crew member's role]: [crew member's name]', e.g.,'chief officer: Dan'.

- [ ] Using for...in, iterate through the spaceship.crew object in the code editor and console.log() a list of crew names and degrees in the following format: '[crew member's name]: [crew member's degree]', i.e.,'Lily: Computer Engineering'.
